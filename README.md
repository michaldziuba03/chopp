> Current state of the project

## Rules and goals of the project

- don't use TUI libraries like ncurses, curses etc. I want to learn how more complex TUI is handled by terminals. Project follows widely supported [vt100](https://www.vt100.net/) standard
- support searching in text
- support syntax highlighting
- support UTF-8
- make it usable for daily use
